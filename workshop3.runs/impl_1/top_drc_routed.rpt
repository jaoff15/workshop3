2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_down/shift_register_reg[3]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_down/counter_down[3]_i_2/O, cell debounce_down/counter_down[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_up/shift_register_reg[3]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_up/counter_up[3]_i_2/O, cell debounce_up/counter_up[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net running_leds0/clock_flash is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin running_leds0/shift_led[3]_i_2/O, cell running_leds0/shift_led[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_down/counter_down[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
level_shift0/counter_down_reg[0], level_shift0/counter_down_reg[1], level_shift0/counter_down_reg[2], level_shift0/counter_down_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_up/counter_up[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
level_shift0/counter_up_reg[0], level_shift0/counter_up_reg[1], level_shift0/counter_up_reg[2], level_shift0/counter_up_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT running_leds0/shift_led[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 7 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
running_leds0/shift_led_reg[0], running_leds0/shift_led_reg[1], running_leds0/shift_led_reg[1]_lopt_replica, running_leds0/shift_led_reg[2], running_leds0/shift_led_reg[2]_lopt_replica, running_leds0/shift_led_reg[3], running_leds0/shift_led_reg[3]_lopt_replica
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
